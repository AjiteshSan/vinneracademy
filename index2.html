                    <h3> Graphic Design </h3>
            <p> Graphic design is the process of communicating a message or telling a story by using visual elements . The goal of
                graphic design is to make information understandable,and visually appealing, often to promote a product, service, or brand.
                Graphic design is important in effective communication because it helps convey information in a visually appealing manner.
                A strong graphic design can reinforce a company's image and make it more recognizable, which is important.</p>

                        <h3> Animating </h3>
                <p> The process of creating the illusion of motion and change by rapidly displaying a sequence of static
                    images that differ only slightly from one another is known as animation. Hand-drawn animation, stop-motion
                    animation, and computer-generated animation are all examples of how it can be created. Animation is an important
                    communication and storytelling tool. Its ability to convey complex information and bring stories to life makes it
                    useful in education, marketing, and entertainment.</p>

                            <h3> Film Editing </h3>
                    <p> Video editing is the process of manipulating and rearranging video shots to create a new work. It entails trimming
                        and cutting footage, as well as adding special effects, audio, and music to create a polished finished product. Video editing
                        will require a variety of software applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, and After effects. Because it is used to create
                        high-quality video content, video editing is an important part of many industries. </p>
